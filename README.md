# virtualLibrary P3Rats

Here is our [project plan](https://padlet.com/ketkic61666/Rats)

### MiniLab: Classes in Python
##### 1. Use an individual section (blueprint) in your Scrum Team project for Mini Lab definition and execution.
  * Aditi
    * [Blueprint Integration in main.py](https://github.com/adhithin/virtualLibrary/blob/bcf48349bf3b05f2a85cd7d77828092cfc67c2bb/main.py#L9-L16)
    * [Blueprinted directory](https://github.com/adhithin/virtualLibrary/tree/main/findabook)
##### 2. Enhance or Define a Class to manage a complex data set
  * [Aditi](https://github.com/adhithin/virtualLibrary/blob/5ca17adc21b038cb4e19b894eccd5281335134f4/findabook/algorithm.py#L1)
##### 3. Create an Object from a Class in Python. 
  * [Aditi](https://github.com/adhithin/virtualLibrary/blob/5ca17adc21b038cb4e19b894eccd5281335134f4/findabook/algorithm.py#L18-L24)
##### 4. Display data or enhanced data from this Python Object on Project Web Page using "getters".
  * Aditi
    * [Getters in algoritm.py](https://github.com/adhithin/virtualLibrary/blob/5ca17adc21b038cb4e19b894eccd5281335134f4/findabook/algorithm.py#L33-L47)
    * [display in algorithm.html](https://github.com/adhithin/virtualLibrary/blob/5ca17adc21b038cb4e19b894eccd5281335134f4/findabook/templates/algorithm.html#L21-L30)
##### 5. Highlight WOW or insight in doing this project.  (ie Mastery Show adding timing to Class to Displaying it on Web)
  * [Aditi](https://github.com/adhithin/virtualLibrary/blob/5ca17adc21b038cb4e19b894eccd5281335134f4/findabook/algorithm.py#L63): In Mr. M's example, the entire fibonacci sequence is shown. However, in my example, I did not want to show the entire list, I just wanted to show the last number. So I used the getter get_lastnumber to do this. 

## Possible Ideas to expand into (and who might be able to them) 

### Sending a newsletter 

this would entail the use of smtp in order to be able to send emails to those who enter their emails in. we could do this by merging it with a form from html. 

@adhithi can do it? 

### Choosing a random book 

we could use a checkbox form in html and python and render different templates based on the genres chosen. 

@adhithi can do it?

### find a library near you 


### shop for your book on amazon


### random book selection
