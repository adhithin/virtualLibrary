## Possible Ideas to expand into (and who might be able to them) 

### Sending a newsletter 

this would entail the use of smtp in order to be able to send emails to those who enter their emails in. we could do this by merging it with a form from html. 

@adhithi can do it? 

### Choosing a random book 

we could use a checkbox form in html and python and render different templates based on the genres chosen. 

@adhithi can do it?

### find a library near you 


### shop for your book on amazon


### random book selection
